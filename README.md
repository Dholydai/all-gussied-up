MAJOR CHANGES HAVE ARRIVED!

This repository will be removed shortly. Replaced with a new one called Banal Bearbug.

I designed wonderfully sleek cases for my Dvorak 2024. All of my keyboard PCBs have been reworked to fit the new cases. 

Human factored PC keyboards for 21st-century writers. The two-hand Dvorak letter scheme is for young writers. A legacy two-hand Qwerty scheme is now included.

The custom Cherry MX KiCad footprint library used is posted at https://github.com/Dholydai/mx-switch-custom
